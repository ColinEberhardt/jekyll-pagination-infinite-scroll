A few months ago I published a blog post which showed the results of [analysing the meta-data of 75,000 apps from the iTunes App Store](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2014/03/20/app-store-analysis.html). This analysis revealed some interesting results; 75% of apps are free, 60% have no ratings and the Entertainment category has the worst user ratings. This blog post continues the analysis by adding 60,000 Android apps into the mix.

For those of you that like their information presented in tweet-sized portions, here are some quick results

- The iOS store has 3.5x more business apps than the Android store, and 2x more Education apps.
- Both stores have roughly the same number of free apps, at 75%
- The most expensive category in the Android store is Medicine at $21 avg, which is double the most expensive iOS category, Business, with an average price of $12.
- The average user rating of Android apps is slightly lower than iOS apps
- The Apple store has 3x more apps with zero user ratings.
