<p>A couple of days ago a published <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/473582/Clearer-A-Gesture-Driven-Windows-8-To-Do-Applicati">a new article on CodeProject</a>, this latest article tackles the migration of a gesture-drive application from Windows Phone to Windows 8:</p>

<p>"I had fun porting my gesture-driven to-do list application to Windows 8, and had an interesting journey along the way. There are lots of little differences between Windows 8 and Windows Phone, which can result in frustration, or worse still there are some features which are just impossible to port or implement. On the flip side, Windows 8 has some really great new features such as live tiles, transitions, snapped views and more besides. Also, the Windows 8 simulator is fantastic, providing multi-touch emulation for users without touch screens, something that I sorely missed as a Windows Phone developer."</p>
