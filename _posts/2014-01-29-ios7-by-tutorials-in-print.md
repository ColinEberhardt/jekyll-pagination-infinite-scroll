A few days ago I was happy to receive a weighty package through the post containing the following:

<br/>

The print copy of "iOS 7 by Tutorials"! - An 804 page book covering all the new and exciting APIs available to iOS developers. I contributed four chapters to this book, **UIKit Dynamics & motion effects**, **Custom View Controller Transitions** and two chapters on **Text Kit**.

Writing these chapters whilst iOS 7 was still in beta was quite a challenge, but I am very happy with the results, with a great deal of credit going to Ray Wenderlich's amazing editorial team.

You can buy the paper copy book via <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/iOS-By-Tutorials-Christine-Abernathy/dp/0989675106">Amazon</a>, or the electronic copy via Ray Wenderlich's <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-7-by-tutorials">website</a>.
