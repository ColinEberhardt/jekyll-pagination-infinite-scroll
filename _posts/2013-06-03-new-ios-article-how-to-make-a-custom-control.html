<p>My latest iOS development article has been <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/36288/how-to-make-a-custom-control">published on Ray Wenderlich's site</a>, this time I look into how to develop custom iOS controls.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/36288/how-to-make-a-custom-control"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2013/06/RangeSliderLeadImage.png" alt="RangeSliderLeadImage" width="250" height="200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2443" /></a></p>
<p>The article describes the creation of a 'range' slider control, and covers topics such as API design and using Core Graphics for rendering.</p>
<p>Interestingly, iOS developers have very few controls at their disposal, Apple's UIKit is pretty sparse. This means that developer's are far more likely to find themselves needing to create custom controls than a Windows Phone developer would be.</p>
<p>Enjoy, Colin E.</p>
