<p>In the past few months I have been immersing myself into the world of iOS development. Whilst the Objective-C language takes a little getting used to, with its odd syntax and memory management rules, it is certainly a fun platform to develop for. I do miss a few C# language features, such as events, but for the most part I am a happy iOS developer.</p>
<p>... that is apart from Linq!</p>

<p>A few weeks back I was writing some examples for a future release of the <a href="http://www.shinobicontrols.com/">ShinobiControls Grid</a>. The example in question required a datasource of people grouped by the first letter of their surname. Despite the use of predicates and key valued sorting, the code looked like this:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray*) createGroupedTestData
{
    NSMutableArray* groupedData = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    
    // create some people
    NSArray* people = [PersonDataSource generatePeople:50];
    
    // create a set of letters - based on the first letter of the surname
    NSMutableSet* groups = [[NSMutableSet alloc] init];
    for(PersonDataObject* person in people)
    {
        [groups addObject:[person.surname substringToIndex:1]];
    }
    
    // create the groups
    for(NSString* letter in groups)
    {
        PersonGroup* group = [[PersonGroup alloc] init];
        group.letter = letter;
        
        // locate the person objects that belong in this group
        NSPredicate* predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithBlock:^BOOL(id evaluatedObject, NSDictionary *bindings) {
            PersonDataObject* person = (PersonDataObject*)evaluatedObject;
            return [[person.surname substringToIndex:1] isEqualToString:letter];
        }];
        group.items = [people filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
        
        [groupedData addObject:group];
    }
    
    // sort the groups
    NSSortDescriptor* sortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@"letter" ascending:YES];
    NSArray* sortedGroupedData = [groupedData sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:@[sortDescriptor]];
    
    return sortedGroupedData;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>That's a pretty unwieldy lump in my opinion. With Linq I am used to performing this sort of logic with a single query!</p>
<p>So, I decided to go ahead and implement a bunch of Linq methods for Objective-C, which results in a much cleaner implementation:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray*) createGroupedTestData
{
    
    // create some people
    NSArray* people = [PersonDataSource generatePeople:50];
    
    Selector firstLetterOfSurname = ^id(id person){
        return [[person surname] substringToIndex:1];
    };
    
    Selector groupForLetter = ^id(id letter) {
        PersonGroup* group = [[PersonGroup alloc] init];
        group.letter = letter;
        group.items = [people where:^BOOL(id person) {
            return [[[person surname] substringToIndex:1] isEqualToString:letter];
        }];
        return group;
    };
    
    return [[[[people   select:firstLetterOfSurname]
                        sort]
                        distinct]
                        select:groupForLetter];
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Not only is the above code more concise, which is nearly always a good thing (unless you are talking regex-concise!), it is also much more readable. The 'select, distinct, sort, select' query makes it much easier to determine what the resulting output of this code will be.</p>
<p>In this blog post I'll explain what Linq is (for those of you who have not heard of it before), and how I implemented Linq-to-Objective-C. If you just want to use the code, you can <a href="https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/LinqToObjectiveC">grab a copy from github</a>.</p>
<h2>An introduction to Linq</h2>
<p>If you are a seasoned .NET developer, you can skip this section, however, if you have not heard of Linq before, then read on ...</p>
<p>Linq was added to the C# language back in 2007. The name 'linq' stands for Language Integrated Query, and as the name implies, its original aim was to more tightly integrate queries into the C# language. As an example, when querying database developers find themselves writing queries using SQL statements embedded within literal strings:</p>
<pre >
string query = "SELECT * FROM Person WHERE age < 10"
</pre>
<p>The problem with the above code is that the SQL statements are not checked by the compiler, and as a result, errors will only surface at runtime. This is not a problem that is peculiar to C# - you will find SQL statements embedded within strings in virtually every language.</p>
<p>With Linq queries are no longer literal strings, they are instead constructed using keywords that are part of the C# language itself:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
var query =  from p in PersonCollection
               where p.age < 10
               select p;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This allows the compiler to check your query syntax, resulting in less error prone code.</p>
<p>C# provides a couple of different syntaxes for Linq, the query syntax, shown above - and the fluent syntax, where method invocations are chained together. </p>
<p>The two are functionally equivalent:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
var query =  from p in PersonCollection
               where p.age < 10
               select p;

var query = PersonCollection.Where(p => p.age < 10); 
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Whilst the application of Linq for querying database is obvious, Linq can be used to query practically anything. The .NET framework supplies Linq to SQL, XML and Objects - while the community has added Linq to CSV, JSON, DataSets, Facebook, and my own contribution <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2010/03/linq-to-visual-tree/">Linq-to-VisualTree</a>.</p>
<p>I've found myself using Linq in virtually every .NET application I have ever written - and I miss it!</p>
<p>Fortunately the ~25 different Linq extensions methods are actually quite easy to implement, as the C# guru Jon Skeet demonstrated in an <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2011/02/23/reimplementing-linq-to-objects-part-45-conclusion-and-list-of-posts.aspx">epic series of blog posts</a>. So, why not bring this API to Objective-C?</p>
<h2>Linq to Objective-C</h2>
<p>In this section I'll rattle through the implementation of a number of Linq methods, for the full set, <a href="https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/LinqToObjectiveC">head to github</a>.</p>
<h3>Where</h3>
<p>The Linq 'where' method filters an array of objects based on a predicate that returns true for any object that should be included in the output array. Using a block for the predicate, gives the following method signature:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
typedef BOOL (^Predicate)(id);

/** Filters a sequence of values based on a predicate.
 
 @param The function to test each source element for a condition.
 @return The elements from the input sequence that satisfy the condition.
 */
- (NSArray*) where:(Predicate)predicate;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Before diving straight into the implementation, I'll demonstrate its usage via a unit test. Given the following array of Person objects:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray*) createTestData
{
    return @[[Person personWithName:@"bob" age:@25],
    [Person personWithName:@"frank" age:@45],
    [Person personWithName:@"ian" age:@35],
    [Person personWithName:@"jim" age:@25],
    [Person personWithName:@"joe" age:@55]];
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Where <code>Person </code>is a simple object with <code>name </code>and <code>age </code>properties. The test I created for the where method is as follows:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)testWhere
{
    NSArray* input = [self createTestData];
    
    NSArray* peopleWhoAre25 = [input where:^BOOL(id person) {
        return [[person age] isEqualToNumber:@25];
    }];
    
    STAssertEquals(peopleWhoAre25.count, 2U, @"There should have been 2 items returned");
    STAssertEquals([peopleWhoAre25[0] name], @"bob", @"Bob is 25!");
    STAssertEquals([peopleWhoAre25[1] name], @"jim", @"Jim is 25!");
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Which simply tests that the simple where query successfully returns all <code>Person </code>instances with an age of 25.</p>
<p>The implementation of where is really quite trivial:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray *)where:(Predicate)predicate
{
    NSMutableArray* result = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    for(id item in self) {
       if (predicate(item)) {
           [result addObject:item];
       }
    }
    return result;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>We're off to a good start!</p>
<p>So, how does this compare to the existing Objective-C APIs? Through the use of predicates it is quite easy to perform the same 'people who are 25' query. You can use block syntax:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
NSPredicate* predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithBlock:^BOOL(id person, NSDictionary *bindings) {
    return [[person age] isEqualToNumber:@25];
}];
NSArray* peopleWhoAre25 = [input filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Or the more concise string-based predicates:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
NSArray* peopleWhoAre25 = [input filteredArrayUsingPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"age=25"]];
{% endhighlight %}
<p>With the Objective-C support for predicates, this Linq-style where method might not be the most useful, but the others are more interesting.</p>
<h3>Select</h3>
<p>The Linq 'select' method allows you to perform transformation, which is known as a projection. Each element is acted upon by a selector function, with the returned result being used to populate the output sequence. Here's the method signature:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
typedef id (^Selector)(id);

/** Projects each element of a sequence into a new form.
 
 @param selector Projects each element of a sequence into a new form.
 @return An array whose elements are the result of invoking the transform function on each element of source.
 */
- (NSArray*) select:(Selector)selector;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Again, I'll demonstrate the using via a unit test. This example uses the select method to extract the <code>name </code>property for each person objects in the source array:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)testSelect
{
    NSArray* input = [self createTestData];
    
    NSArray* names = [input select:^id(id person) {
        return [person name];
    }];
    
    STAssertEquals(names.count, 5U, nil);
    // 'spot' check a few values
    STAssertEquals(names[0], @"bob", nil);
    STAssertEquals(names[4], @"joe", nil);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Again, the implementation is really quite simple:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray *)select:(Selector)selector
{
    NSMutableArray* result = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    for(id item in self) {
        [result addObject:selector(item)];
    }
    return result;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Sort</h3>
<p>Linq doesn't actually have a sort method, instead it provides <code>OrderBy</code> and <code>ThenBy</code> methods. Because I don't want to get into multi-property sorting, I'll substitute both of these for a single 'sort' function.</p>
<p>/** Sorts the elements of a sequence in ascending order.</p>
<p> @return An array whose elements are sorted in ascending order. */- (NSArray*) sort;</p>
<p>/** Sorts the elements of a sequence in ascending order by using a specified keySelector.</p>
<p> @param keySelector A selector that provides the 'key' which the array should by sorted by.  @return An array whose elements are sorted in ascending order. */- (NSArray*) sort:(Selector)keySelector;</p>
<p>The first method simply sorts the array by invoking the compare method on each object. The second uses a selector to extract the key that is then used for the comparison.</p>
<p>The unit tests are as follows:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)testSort
{
    NSArray* input = @[@21, @34, @25];
    
    NSArray* sortedInput = [input sort];
    
    STAssertEquals(sortedInput.count, 3U, nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(sortedInput[0], @21, nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(sortedInput[1], @25, nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(sortedInput[2], @34, nil);
}

- (void)testSortWithKeySelector
{
    NSArray* input = [self createTestData];
    
    NSArray* sortedByName = [input sort:^id(id person) {
        return [person name];
    }];
    
    STAssertEquals(sortedByName.count, 5U, nil);
    STAssertEquals([sortedByName[0] name], @"bob", nil);
    STAssertEquals([sortedByName[1] name], @"frank", nil);
    STAssertEquals([sortedByName[2] name], @"ian", nil);
    STAssertEquals([sortedByName[3] name], @"jim", nil);
    STAssertEquals([sortedByName[4] name], @"joe", nil);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>As you can see, one simply sorts an array of <code>NSNumber </code>instances, whereas the other sorts an array of <code>People</code> instances via the name property using the key selector.</p>
<p>The implementation is as follows:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray *)sort:(Selector)keySelector
{
    return [self sortedArrayUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(id obj1, id obj2) {
        id valueOne = keySelector(obj1);
        id valueTwo = keySelector(obj2);
        NSComparisonResult result = [valueOne compare:valueTwo];
        return result;
    }];
}

- (NSArray *)sort
{
    return [self sort:^id(id item) { return item;} ];
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The sort-with-keySelector method makes use of the <code>NSArray</code> sort method that sorts via the result returned by a block. The 'natural' sort simply uses an identity selector in order to re-use the same implementation.</p>
<h3>OfType</h3>
<p>The Linq of-type method is use to filter a list of objects to remove all of those which are not of a specific type. Here's the method signature:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
/** Filters the elements of an an array based on a specified type.
 
 @param type The type to filter the elements of the sequence on.
 @return An array whose elements are all of the given type.
 */
- (NSArray*) ofType:(Class)type;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>And here is the associated test:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)testOfType
{
    NSArray* mixed = @[@"foo", @25, @"bar", @33];
    
    NSArray* strings = [mixed ofType:[NSString class]];
    
    STAssertEquals(strings.count, 2U, nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(strings[0], @"foo", nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(strings[1], @"bar", nil);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Which filters out the <code>NSString </code>instances from a mixed array.</p>
<p>The implementation is quite trivial, making use of the where method which was detailed above:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray *)ofType:(Class)type
{
    return [self where:^BOOL(id item) {
        return [[item class] isSubclassOfClass:type];
    }];
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The <code>ofType </code>method is quite useful for tasks such as finding all the subviews of a <code>UIView </code>that are of a specific type.</p>
<h3>Distinct</h3>
<p>The distinct method returns the distinct elements from an array, in other words, it removes duplicates based on an equality comparison. The signature is as follows:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
/** Returns distinct elements from a sequence.
 
 @return An array of distinct elements.
 */
- (NSArray*) distinct;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The unit test is as follows:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)testDistinct
{
    NSArray* names = @[@"bill", @"bob", @"bob", @"brian", @"bob"];
    
    NSArray* distinctNames = [names distinct];
    
    STAssertEquals(distinctNames.count, 3U, nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(distinctNames[0], @"bill", nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(distinctNames[1], @"brian", nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(distinctNames[2], @"bob", nil);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The implementation uses an <code>NSMutableArray </code>to construct an array of unique objects:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray *)distinct
{
    NSMutableArray* distinctSet = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    for (id item in self) {
        if (![distinctSet containsObject:item]) {
            [distinctSet addObject:item];
        }
    }
    return distinctSet;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Note that the use of <code>containsObject </code>on an <code>NSMutableArray </code>is a potential performance issue for large arrays of data. A better method might make use of an <code>NSSet </code>which uses the object's hash in order to more quickly determine whether an item is already contained within a set.</p>
<h3>Select Many</h3>
<p>The Linq select-many method is projection where the selector returns an array of objects. The select-many function flattens the returned arrays into a single array. For a <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/a-visual-look-at-the-linq-selectmany-operator">good visual explanation of select-many check out this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the method signature:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
/** Projects each element of a sequence to an NSArray and flattens the resulting sequences into one sequence.
 
 @param transform A transform function to apply to each element, this should return an NSArray.
 @return An array whose elements are the result of invoking the one-to-many transform function on each element of the input sequence.
 */
- (NSArray*) selectMany:(Selector)transform;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The unit test takes an array of string, projecting each element to an array via the <code>componentsSeparatedByString </code>method:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)testSelectMany
{
    NSArray* data = @[@"foo, bar", @"fubar"];
    
    NSArray* components = [data selectMany:^id(id string) {
        return [string componentsSeparatedByString:@", "];
    }];
    
    STAssertEquals(components.count, 3U, nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(components[0], @"foo", nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(components[1], @"bar", nil);
    STAssertEqualObjects(components[2], @"fubar", nil);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>A more realistic example might take an array of orders, projecting each order to the order-items that it contains, with the result being all of the order-items over all orders ... this could of course be followed by a 'distinct' query which would find all the distinct (i.e. unique) items ordered for a collection of orders.</p>
<p>The implementation involves a couple of nested for-in loops:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSArray *)selectMany:(Selector)transform
{
    NSMutableArray* result = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    for(id item in self) {
        for(id child in transform(item)){
            [result addObject:child];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Aggregate</h3>
<p>The next Linq method, aggregate, is an interesting one because it doesn't return an array, instead it applies an accumulator function to the elements of an array, returning a single result. The signature is as follows:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
/** Applies an accumulator function over a sequence.
 
 @param accumulator An accumulator function to be invoked on each element.
 @return The final accumulator value.
 */
- (id) aggregate:(Accumulator)accumulator;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The unit test uses this method to convert an array of strings into a CSV:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (void)testAggregate
{
    NSArray* names = @[@"bill", @"bob", @"brian"];
    
    id aggregate = [names aggregate:^id(id item, id aggregate) {
        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@, %@", aggregate, item];
    }];
    
    STAssertEqualObjects(aggregate, @"bill, bob, brian", nil);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Although you can use aggregate to do all sorts of things, such as find the maximum value for an array of integers.</p>
<p>The implementation is pretty simple, seeding the aggregate with the initial value and using the accumulator for subsequent items:</p>
{% highlight objective-c %}
- (id)aggregate:(Accumulator)accumulator
{
    id aggregate = nil;
    for (id item in self) {
        if (aggregate == nil) {
            aggregate = item;
        } else {
            aggregate = accumulator(item, aggregate);
        }
    }
    return aggregate;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<h2>A brief note on deferred execution</h2>
<p>In C# Linq methods do not act on arrays, instead they act upon the <code>IEnumerable<T></code> interface. This allows them to query anything that can be enumerated, which not only includes arrays, but can also include infinite sources of data (such as a stream of random numbers). The implementation of Linq relies on the 'yield' keyword, which results in the C# compiler creating a state machine to implement the <code>IEnumerable<T></code> interface.</p>
<p>The practical implication of all this very clever stuff is that Linq queries are not executed immediately. As an example, when you create a query as follows:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
var query = PersonCollection.Where(p => p.Age < 10)
                            .OrderBy(p => p.Name);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Nothing will actually happen until you start to enumerate the 'query' variable. In other words, you have to 'pull' data from the query. </p>
<p>This results in a feature which is often called 'deferred execution', where queries are executed on demand. This can yield tremendous performance benefits, allowing queries to terminate early.</p>
<p>Objective-C does not have 'yield' keyword, making it hard to implement Linq in such a way as to allow deferred execution. I did actually manage to create an implementation of a few query methods where each were presented as a state machine. Also, the Obj-C for-in iterator uses the <code>NSFastEnumeration</code>, which I was able to implement giving deferred execution and early termination. However, I decided to stick with the much simpler <code>NSArray </code>implementation here. If anyone is interested in the more complex version, give me a shout - I'd be happy to share.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Creating a Linq-style API for Objective-C has proven to be relatively simple (and fun!). I have provided implementations for some of the most common and useful Linq methods, however the .NET Linq APIs for querying collections have a great many more methods than the ones I have covered. </p>
<p>If you are interested, why not <a href="https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/LinqToObjectiveC">pop over to github</a>, fork and add a few more? I'll probably add to this project myself over time.</p>
<p>Regards, Colin E.</p>
