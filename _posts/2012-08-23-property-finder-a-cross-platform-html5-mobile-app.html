<p>A while back, when PhoneGap for Windows Phone was still in beta, I created Property Finder, an application for searching UK property listings. This application successfully made its way into the Windows Phone Marketplace, <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2011/11/property-finder-the-first-html5-based-windows-phone-7-application/" title="Property Finder - the first HTML5-based Windows Phone 7 Application">making it the first WP7 PhoneGap app</a>.</p>
<p>I recently developed the Property Finder application further in order to support iPhone. You can see the application running on both devices below:</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/445361/Property-Finder-a-cross-platform-HTML5-mobile-app">published an article on CodeProject which describes this application in detai</a>l, and also has the full sourcecode.</p>
