<p>About a month ago I published an article which demonstrated how to <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2011/12/a-simple-multi-page-windows-phone-7-phonegap-example/" title="A Simple Multi-Page Windows Phone 7 PhoneGap Example">create a WP7 application using static HTML pages and PhoneGap</a>. Whilst PhoneGap makes the packaging of HTML / JavaScript / CSS and images into a breeze, one thing it doesn't do is provide correct back-button support. Correct back-button support is a mandatory requirement for marketplace certification. Hitting the back button should navigate back through the various screens of an application. Hitting the back-button on the first screen should terminate the application. </p>
<p>The solution I published previously handles the WP7 back keypress in order to keep track of the back-stack depth. When the back-stack depth is just one, a back-button press exits the application. This works fine if backwards navigation is always controlled via the hardware back-button, however if your application has HTML anchor elements that navigate back to a previous page, or you use code such as <code>javascript:history.go(-1)</code>, this back-stack handling code will not detect that a backwards navigation has occurred.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, WP7 applications really should use the hardware back-button for navigation. If you are writing a cross-platform PhoneGap application consider adapting your UI for each platform. This means removing the back-button you woudl have in your iOS version when 'skinning' for WP7.</em></p>
<p>In order to solve this issue I have updated the code to inspect the URL that the browser control is navigating to in order to detect backwards navigation. The class now maintains a list of URLs, which represent the navigation stack. This allows it to detect a backwards navigation.</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
/// <summary>
/// Handles the back-button for a PhoneGap application. When the back-button
/// is pressed, the browser history is navigated. If no history is present,
/// the application will exit.
/// </summary>
public class BackButtonHandler
{
  private WebBrowser _browser;

  private List<string> _backStack = new List<string>();

  public BackButtonHandler(PhoneApplicationPage page, PGView phoneGapView)
  {
    // subscribe to the hardware back-button
    page.BackKeyPress += Page_BackKeyPress;

    _browser = phoneGapView.Browser;

    // handle navigation events
    _browser.Navigated += Browser_Navigated;

  }

  /// <summary>
  /// Handle navigation in order to update our back-stack
  /// </summary>
  private void Browser_Navigated(object sender, NavigationEventArgs e)
  {
    string url = _browser.Source.OriginalString;

    // ensure all slashes are the same
    // app\www/index.html
    // see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-184
    url = url.Replace("\\", "/");

    if (_backStack.Count < 2)
    {
      _backStack.Add(url);
    }
    else
    {
      // check whether the URL represents a backwards navigation
      string previousPage = _backStack[_backStack.Count - 2];
      if (previousPage == url)
      {
        _backStack.RemoveAt(_backStack.Count - 1);
      }
    }
  }

  /// <summary>
  /// Handle the hardware back-button
  /// </summary>
  private void Page_BackKeyPress(object sender, CancelEventArgs e)
  {
    // if we have items in the back-stack, route this event
    // to the browser
    if (_backStack.Count > 1)
    {
      _browser.InvokeScript("eval", "history.go(-1)");
      e.Cancel = true;
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Note: There use of <code>url.Replace("\\", "/")</code>, this is due to a minor issue with the PhoneGap WP7 native code, which I have raised in the Callback JIRA (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-184">CB-184</a>).</p>
<p>To use this code simply create an instance of the class, passing the PGView (the PhoneGap user control) into teh constructor:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public MainPage()
{
  InitializeComponent();

  new BackButtonHandler(this, PGView);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Because back-button handling is a mandatory requirement for WP7 applications, hopefully Nitobi will incorporate this code (or similar) into the <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/apps">PhoneGap Build service</a> (which I tried earlier this week - it is pretty amazing!)</p>
<p>You can download a working example here: <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/archive/2012/01/HTML5SandwichFlow1.zip'>HTML5SandwichFlow.zip</a></p>
<p>(The first three recipe pages have 'back' anchor elements, two use the URL, one uses JavaScript)</p>
