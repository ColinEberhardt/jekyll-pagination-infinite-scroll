<p>Yesterday I published a new article on CodePrioject:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/520069/Property-Finder-a-Cross-Platform-Xamarin-MonoTouch">Property Finder - a Cross-Platform Xamarin MonoTouch Mobile App</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This article looks at how you can write a cross-platform mobile application with a shared C# code base using Xamarin MonoTouch. The application that is described in the article, a property finder, is exactly the same one that <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/445361/Property-Finder-a-Cross-Platform-HTML5-Mobile-App">I wrote using HTML5</a> a few months earlier. This most recent article provides an interesting comparison of the two different techniques.</p>
<p>I actually wrote most of this article about two months ago, it was at this point I decided to embark on <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2012/12/introducing-propertycross-helping-you-select-a-cross-platform-mobile-framework/" title="Introducing PropertyCross - Helping you select a cross-platform mobile framework">PropertyCross</a>, which provides a comparison of a wide range of cross-platform frameworks.</p>
<p>After finishing PropertyCross I decided that the original article was still worth publishing, it provides a lot of technical detail on how to code share with Xamarin specifically. </p>
<p>So, why not pop over to CodeProject and check it out?</p>
